# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description
The goal of this project was to create a work schedule where the employee can add important events to it. The schedule has past-present- future time-block colour coding. 

I learnt how to create/use: 
- Event listener when the save button is clicked to add a task to the schedule 
- Day.js to format the time to 24 hour time
- Conditional formatting to the time-blocks with reference to the current time 
- Getitem function to get the saved task from local storage and to load it even when the page reloads
